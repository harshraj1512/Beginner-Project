# Weather App

## Overview

This repository contains a **Weather App** built to display weather information based on user input. The app provides a seamless and dynamic experience by utilizing React's `useState` for state management and a key stroke functionality to fetch data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/). Additionally, the background dynamically changes based on the temperature, offering a visually immersive experience.

## Features

1. **State Management with `useState`**  
   - State is managed using React's built-in `useState` hook for simplicity and efficiency.

2. **Key Stroke API Calls**  
   - Automatically fetches weather data as the user types, providing real-time results with minimal delay.

3. **Dynamic Backgrounds**  
   - Changes the background based on the weather conditions:
     - **Cold Weather**: Displays a cool, icy background.
     - **Hot Weather**: Shows a warm, sunny background.

4. **OpenWeatherMap Integration**  
   - Fetches real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, and conditions, using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js** for building the UI.
- **useState Hook** for state management.
- **OpenWeatherMap API** for weather data.
- **CSS** for dynamic styling of the background.
